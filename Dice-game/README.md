# Dice-game

To create a Dice game in a React project, use useState to manage the state of the dice values and Math.random to generate random numbers for the dice roll. Create a button that triggers the dice roll and updates the state with the new values. Render the dice values on the screen, and you're set for some dice-rolling fun! ðŸŽ²
