## project1:
# Counter
       
       The Counter Project in React involves setting up a basic app where users can increment or decrement a counter value. It uses React components and hooks,            specifically {useState}, to manage and display the count. This project is an excellent introduction to understanding React's fundamental concepts like state        management and event handling.

## project2:
# Background-changer
To implement a background changer in a React project, you can use state to manage the background color value and set the style property on a component. Use a button or other input to update the state value with the desired color, causing the component to re-render with the new background color. The useState and onClick event handler can help achieve this.

## project3:
# Dice-game
To create a Dice game in a React project, use useState to manage the state of the dice values and Math.random to generate random numbers for the dice roll. Create a button that triggers the dice roll and updates the state with the new values. Render the dice values on the screen, and you're set for some dice-rolling fun! ðŸŽ²

## project4:
# Password-genrator
To create a password generator in a React project, use useState to manage the password value and create a function that generates a random password using characters, numbers, and symbols. Include input fields to set the password criteria (length, character types) and a button to trigger the password generation. Finally, display the generated password on the screen for the user to copy.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
