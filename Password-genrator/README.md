# Password-genrator

To create a password generator in a React project, use useState to manage the password value and create a function that generates a random password using characters, numbers, and symbols. Include input fields to set the password criteria (length, character types) and a button to trigger the password generation. Finally, display the generated password on the screen for the user to copy.
